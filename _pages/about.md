I am a dual major PhD student in the [Department of Forestry](https://www.canr.msu.edu/for/) and [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). Prior to my graduate studies, I received my Bachelors of Science in Biology with a Mathematics minor from [George Fox University](https://www.georgefox.edu/) in Newberg, OR. 

My research interests include spatio-temporal statistics, small area estimation, multivariate statistics, Bayesian hierarchical modeling, carbon monitoring and forest inventory. Outside of research and teaching, I enjoy gardening, jazz music, and riding my bike.
