I am a Senior Operational Analyst on the [Asset and Wildfire Risk](https://portlandgeneral.com/outages-safety/safety/wildfire-safety-and-prevention) team  at [Portland General Electric](https://portlandgeneral.com/). I received a dual major PhD in Forestry and Statistics from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) where I developed Bayesian spatio-temporal models for forest inventory small area estimation. Prior to my graduate studies, I received my Bachelors of Science in Biology with a Mathematics minor from [George Fox University](https://www.georgefox.edu/) in Newberg, OR.
